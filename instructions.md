# Swap Controller

This first version monitors your BTC and XBT coordinator nodes using read-only
credentials. It cannot quote swaps, send payments or move funds. It can run on
either StartOS box as long as that box can reach both HTTPS endpoints.

## Pair your nodes

1. Start the package. Health waits for pairing.
2. Open **Pair Coordinator Nodes**.
3. For each node, enter its HTTPS base URL, expected node ID, dedicated read-only
   rune, and complete public root CA certificate in PEM format.
4. Confirm saving. Leave replacement disabled for the first pair.
5. Run the action. Both identities and networks must verify before saving.
6. Check **Connection Status** and the **Coordinator Connections** health check.

Use the dedicated rune from each coordinator's **Create or Show Read-only
Controller Credential** action. Never use a general administrative rune.
For the BTC CLNrest connection string, change clnrest+https:// to https:// and
remove the query string (including any embedded rune). Enter the restricted
rune only in its separate masked field. Do not paste credentials into logs or
support messages. Obtain each CA from its authenticated StartOS session; do not
disable TLS verification.

The service refreshes health roughly every 30 seconds. A stale result cannot
keep it green. Zero channels is allowed for connection monitoring; green does
not establish sufficient liquidity, a payment route or swap readiness.

To change saved connection details, enter the full pair and enable the explicit
replacement toggle. A failed verification preserves the old pair. If a probe
holds the action lock, wait for it to finish and repeat the action. Repeating
pairing never sends a payment.

## Backups

This version excludes connection credentials and health snapshots from backups.
After restoring it, pair the nodes again. Existing credentials on the nodes are
not revoked by controller restoration. Store your restricted runes and public
CA files securely or retrieve them through each node's actions.

There is no web UI, inbound API or additional Lightning node in this package.
# Developer test: swap recovery over HTTPS

The installed controller remains read-only. Its live pairing, restart,
restore-to-unpaired and re-pairing checks have passed.

On the packaging VM, the next test uses disposable regtest coins and the
existing BTC/XBT images. Keep this repository beside `btc-cln-startos`:

```bash
python3 tests/test_https_rpc.py -v &&
python3 tests/test_controller.py -v &&
bash scripts/test-remote-controller.sh \
  btc-cln:swap-preparation xbt-cln:recovery-test ../bitcoind all
```

This covers settlement and outgoing failure in both directions, coordinator
restarts with payments pending, and fresh controller recovery over HTTPS.
The test creates its own method-restricted credentials and certificates.
It does not use your saved pairing or either live wallet.

Then repeat with the submission reply discarded before the controller receives
it. Recovery must find the original attempt without submitting another:

```bash
bash scripts/test-remote-controller.sh \
  btc-cln:swap-preparation xbt-cln:recovery-test ../bitcoind all --drop-send-reply
```

No package rebuild or installation is required. Successful tests establish
regtest transport compatibility, not readiness for live swaps.
